project goal:

alternative frontend for tryhackme and hackthebox


this is the stack:
opentui + ink for ui (ts)
vercel ai sdk (ts)
tools
db

github


the goal is to make a cute terminal agent similar to claude, but for cybersecurity. On the backend we connect to tryhackme and hackthebox.

so the flow is chat with agent just like claude code, and the agent (sonder btw) goes and does the tryhackmeVMs instead of pair programming its pair hacking, and its a good first step for ai asisted pentesting in a learning environnement.

i put screen shot of what i want the ui to be, feel free to asj questions.
